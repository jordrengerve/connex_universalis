# connex_universalis

Connex Universalis is a graph visualisation project. It intends to develop a network of brainstormed ideas about the World we live in. The visualisation is important in the ideation. This project intends to create a lightweight web rendering of the graph of ideas. The rendering is created in javascript and is hosted in http://graphuniversalis.comxa.com/

The ideation is the result of the brainstorming between Job Nijsen and Jord Rolland de Rengerv√©.
